You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Gauss transformations}
Let $G = I-\tau e_k^T$ be a Gauss transformation matrix (so the only
nonzeros in $\tau$ appear after entry $k$).  Then
\begin{itemize}
\item Show that $G^{-1} = I+\tau e_k^T$.
\item Argue that $\|G\|_\infty = 1 + \|\tau\|_\infty$ and
  $\|G\|_1 = 1 + \|\tau\|_1$.
\item The singular values of $G$ are all one, except for two of them
  that are the positive roots of the equation
  \[
    p(\sigma^2) = 1 - (2+\|\tau_k\|^2) \sigma^2 + \sigma^4 = 0.
  \]
  Using this fact (which you are not required to prove), write a code
  $\kappa_2(G) = \|G\|_2 \|G^{-1}\|_2 = \sigma_1(G) / \sigma_n(G)$.
  Your code should give remain accurate (to within a few ulps) when
  $\|\tau\|$ is very large or small (including $\tau = 0$).
\end{itemize}
Bonus: Prove the fact about the singular values used in the second part.

\paragraph*{2: Follow the arrow}
Consider the {\em arrow matrix}
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} D & b \\ c^T & f \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $D$ is diagonal.
\begin{itemize}
\item Show that $A$ is invertible if the diagonal entries $d_i$ are
  all nonzero and $f-\sum_i b_i c_i / d_i \neq 0$.
\item Write an $O(n)$ time routine to compute $\det(A)$
\item Write an $O(n)$ time routine to solve the system $Ax = y$.
\end{itemize}
Your codes should follow either the \matlab\ or the Julia template in
the class repository.

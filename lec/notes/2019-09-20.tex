\section{Packed storage}

In $LU$ factorization, the locations where we write the multipliers in
$L$ are exactly the same locations where we introduce zeros in $A$ as we
transform to $U$.  Thus, we can re-use the storage space for $A$ to
store both $L$ (except for the diagonal ones, which are implicit) and
$U$.  Using this strategy, we have the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}
%
% Overwrite A with L and U factors
%
function [A] = mylu(A)
  n = length(A);
  for j=1:n-1
    A(j+1:n,j) = A(j+1:n,j)/A(j,j);
    A(j+1:n,j+1:n) = A(j+1:n,j+1:n) - A(j+1:n,j)*A(j,j+1:n);
  end
\end{lstlisting}
If we wanted to extract the $L$ and $U$ factors explicitly, we could
then do
\begin{lstlisting}
  LU = mylu(A);
  L = eye(length(A)) + tril(A,-1);
  U = triu(A);
\end{lstlisting}

The bulk of the work at step $j$ of the elimination algorithm is in
the computation of a rank-one update to the trailing submatrix.
How much work is there in total?  In eliminating column $j$, we do
$(n-j)^2$ multiplies and the same number of subtractions; so in all,
the number of multiplies (and adds) is
\[
  \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (n-j)^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^2 = \frac{1}{6} n^3 + O(n^2)
\]
We also perform $O(n^2)$ divisions.  Thus, Gaussian elimination, like
matrix multiplication, is an $O(n^3)$ algorithm operating on $O(n^2)$ data.

\section{Schur complements}

The idea of expressing a step of Gaussian elimination as a low-rank
submatrix update turns out to be sufficiently useful that we give it
a name.  At any given step of Gaussian elimination, the trailing
submatrix is called a {\em Schur complement}.  We investigate the
structure of the Schur complements by looking at an $LU$
factorization in block 2-by-2 form:
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    A_{11} & A_{12} \\
    A_{21} & A_{22}
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    L_{11} & 0 \\
    L_{21} & L_{22}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    U_{11} & U_{12} \\
        0 & U_{22}
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    L_{11} U_{11} & L_{11} U_{12} \\
    L_{21} U_{11} & L_{22} U_{22} + L_{21} U_{12}
  \end{bmatrix}.
\]
We can compute $L_{11}$ and $U_{11}$ as $LU$ factors of the leading
sub-block $A_{11}$, and
\begin{align*}
  U_{12} &= L_{11}^{-1} A_{12} \\
  L_{21} &= A_{21} U_{11}^{-1}.
\end{align*}
What about $L_{22}$ and $U_{22}$?  We have
\begin{align*}
  L_{22} U_{22}
  &= A_{22} - L_{21} U_{12} \\
  &= A_{22} - A_{21} U_{11}^{-1} L_{11}^{-1} A_{12} \\
  &= A_{22} - A_{21} A_{11}^{-1} A_{12}.
\end{align*}
This matrix $S = A_{22} - A_{21} A_{11}^{-1} A_{12}$ is the block analogue
of the rank-1 update computed in the first step of the standard
Gaussian elimination algorithm.

For our purposes, the idea of a Schur complement is important because
it will allow us to write blocked variants of Gaussian elimination ---
an idea we will take up in more detail shortly.
But the Schur complement actually has meaning beyond being a matrix that
mysteriously appears as a by-product of Gaussian elimination.
In particular, note that if $A$ and $A_{11}$ are both invertible,
then
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\ A_{21} & A_{22} \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} X \\ S^{-1} \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ I \end{bmatrix},
\]
i.e. $S^{-1}$ is the $(2,2)$ submatrix of $A^{-1}$.

\section{Blocked Gaussian elimination}
Just as we could rewrite matrix multiplication in block form, we can also
rewrite Gaussian elimination in block form.  For example, if we want
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\ A_{21} & A_{22} \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} L_{11} & 0 \\ L_{21} & L_{22} \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} U_{11} & U_{12} \\ 0 & U_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\]
then we can write Gaussian elimination as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Factor $A_{11} = L_{11} U_{11}$.
\item
  Compute $L_{21} = A_{21} U_{11}^{-1}$ and $U_{12} = L_{11}^{-1} A_{12}$.
\item
  Form the Schur complement $S = A_{22} - L_{21} U_{12}$ and factor
  $L_{22} U_{22} = S$.
\end{enumerate}

This same idea works for more than a block 2-by-2 matrix.
Suppose {\tt idx} is a \matlab\ vector that indicates the first index
in each block of variables, so that block $A_{IJ}$ is extracted as
\begin{lstlisting}
  I = idx(i):idx(i+1)-1;
  J = idx(j):idx(j+1)-1;
  A_IJ = A(idx(i):idx(i+1)-1, idx(j):idx(j+1)-1);
\end{lstlisting}
Then we can write the following code for block LU factorization:
\begin{lstlisting}
  M = length(idx)-1;          % Number of blocks
  for j = 1:M
    J    = idx(j):idx(j+1)-1; % Indices for block J
    rest = idx(j+1):n;        % Indices after block J
    A(J,J) = lu(A(J,J));      % Factor submatrix A_JJ

    % Extract L and U (this could be implicit)
    L_JJ   = tril(A(J,J),-1) + eye(length(J));
    U_JJ   = triu(A(J,J));

    % Compute block column of L and row of U, Schur complement
    A(rest,J) = A(rest,J)/U_JJ;
    A(J,rest) = L_JJ\A(J,rest);
    A(rest,rest) = A(rest,rest)-A(rest,J)*A(J,rest);
  end
\end{lstlisting}

As with matrix multiply, thinking about Gaussian elimination in this
blocky form lets us derive variants that have better cache efficiency.
Notice that all the operations in this blocked code involve matrix-matrix
multiplies and multiple back solves with the same matrix.  These routines
can be written in a cache-efficient way, since they do many floating point
operations relative to the total amount of data involved.

Though some of you might make use of cache blocking ideas in your own
work, most of you will never try to write a cache-efficient Gaussian
elimination routine of your own.  The routines in LAPACK and \matlab\
(really the same routines) are plenty efficient, so you would most
likely turn to them.  Still, it is worth knowing how to think about
block Gaussian elimination, because sometimes the ideas can be specialized
to build fast solvers for linear systems when there are fast solvers for
sub-matrices

For example, consider the {\em bordered} matrix
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} B & W \\ V^T & C \end{bmatrix},
\]
where $B$ is an $n$-by-$n$ matrix for which we have a fast
solver and $C$ is a $p$-by-$p$ matrix, $p \ll n$.
We can factor $A$ into a product of {\em block} lower and
upper triangular factors with a simple form:
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} B & W \\ V^T & C \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} B   & 0 \\ V^T & L_{22} \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} I & B^{-1} W \\ 0 & U_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $L_{22} U_{22} = C-V^T B^{-1} W$ is an ordinary (small) factorization
of the trailing Schur complement.  To solve the linear system
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} B & W \\ V^T & C \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix},
\]
we would then run block forward and backward substitution:
\begin{align*}
  y_1 &= B^{-1} b_1 \\
  y_2 &= L_{22}^{-1} \left( b_2 - V^T y_1 \right) \\
\\
  x_2 &= U_{22}^{-1} y_2 \\
  x_1 &= y_1-B^{-1} (W x_2)
\end{align*}

\section{Backward error in Gaussian elimination}

Solving $Ax = b$ in finite precision using Gaussian elimination
followed by forward and backward substitution yields a computed
solution $\hat{x}$ {\em exactly} satisfies
\begin{equation} \label{gauss-bnd}
  (A + \delta A) \hat{x} = b,
\end{equation}
where $|\delta A| \lesssim 3n\macheps |\hat{L}| |\hat{U}|$, assuming
$\hat{L}$ and $\hat{U}$ are the computed $L$ and $U$ factors.

I will now briefly sketch a part of the error analysis following
Demmel's treatment (\S 2.4.2).  Mostly, this is because I find the
treatment in \S 3.3.1 of Van Loan less clear than I would like -- but
also, the bound in Demmel's book is marginally tighter.  Here is the
idea.  Suppose $\hat{L}$ and $\hat{U}$ are the computed $L$ and $U$
factors.  We obtain $\hat{u}_{jk}$ by repeatedly subtracting $l_{ji}
u_{ik}$ from the original $a_{jk}$, i.e.
\[
  \hat{u}_{jk} =
    \fl\left( a_{jk} - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \hat{l}_{ji} \hat{u}_{ik} \right).
\]
Regardless of the order of the sum, we get an error that looks like
\[
  \hat{u}_{jk} = a_{jk}(1+\delta_0) -
                 \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \hat{l}_{ji} \hat{u}_{ik} (1+\delta_i) +
                 O(\macheps^2)
\]
where $|\delta_i| \leq (j-1) \macheps$.  Turning this around gives
\begin{align*}
  a_{jk} & =
  \frac{1}{1+\delta_0} \left(
    \hat{l}_{jj} \hat{u}_{jk} +
    \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \hat{l}_{ji} \hat{u}_{ik} (1 + \delta_i)
  \right) + O(\macheps^2) \\
  & =
    \hat{l}_{jj} \hat{u}_{jk} (1 - \delta_0) +
    \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \hat{l}_{ji} \hat{u}_{ik} (1 + \delta_i - \delta_0) +
    O(\macheps^2) \\
  & =
    \left( \hat{L} \hat{U} \right)_{jk} + e_{jk},
\end{align*}
where
\[
   e_{jk} =
    -\hat{l}_{jj} \hat{u}_{jk} \delta_0 +
    \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \hat{l}_{ji} \hat{u}_{ik} (\delta_i - \delta_0) +
    O(\macheps^2)
\]
is bounded in magnitude by $(j-1) \macheps (|L||U|)_{jk} + O(\macheps^2)$\footnote{
  It's obvious that $e_{jk}$ is bounded in magnitude by $2(j-1)
  \macheps(|L||U|)_{jk} + O(\macheps^2)$.  We cut a factor of two if
  we go down to the level of looking at the individual rounding errors
  during the dot product, because some of those errors cancel.
}.
A similar argument for the components of $\hat{L}$ yields
\[
  A = \hat{L} \hat{U} + E, \mbox{ where }
  |E| \leq n \macheps |\hat{L}| |\hat{U}| + O(\macheps^2).
\]

In addition to the backward error due to the computation of the $LU$
factors, there is also backward error in the forward and backward
substitution phases, which gives the overall bound (\ref{gauss-bnd}).
\section{Pivoting}

The backward error analysis in the previous section is not completely
satisfactory, since $|L| |U|$ may be much larger than $|A|$, yielding
a large backward error overall.  For example, consider the matrix
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} \delta & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} =
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \delta^{-1} & 1 \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix} \delta & 1 \\ 0 & 1-\delta^{-1} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
If $0 < \delta \ll 1$ then $\|L\|_{\infty} \|U\|_{\infty} \approx
\delta^{-2}$, even though $\|A\|_{\infty} \approx 2$.  The problem is
that we ended up subtracting a huge multiple of the first row from the
second row because $\delta$ is close to zero --- that is, the leading
principle minor is {\em nearly} singular.  If $\delta$ were exactly
zero, then the factorization would fall apart even in exact
arithmetic.  The solution to the woes of singular and near singular minors
is pivoting; instead of solving a system with $A$, we re-order the
equations to get
\[
  \hat{A} =
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \delta & 1 \end{bmatrix} =
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \delta & 1 \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1-\delta \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Now the triangular factors for the re-ordered system matrix $\hat{A}$
have very modest norms, and so we are happy.  If we think of the re-ordering
as the effect of a permutation matrix $P$, we can write
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} \delta & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} =
      \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \delta & 1 \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1-\delta \end{bmatrix}
    = P^T LU.
\]
Note that this is equivalent to writing $P A = LU$ where $P$
is another permutation (which undoes the action of $P^T$).

If we wish to control the multipliers, it's natural to choose
the permutation $P$ so that each of the multipliers is at most one.
This standard choice leads to the following algorithm:
\begin{lstlisting}
  for j = 1:n-1

    % Find ipiv >= j to maximize |A(i,j)|
    [absAij, ipiv] = max(abs(A(j:n,j)));
    ipiv = ipiv + j-1;

    % Swap row ipiv and row j
    Aj = A(j,j:n);
    A(j,j:n) = A(ipiv,j:n);
    A(ipiv,j:n) = Aj;

    % Record the pivot row
    piv(j) = ipiv;

    % Update trailing submatrix
    A(j+1:n,j+1:n) = A(j+1:n,j+1:n) - A(j+1:n,j)*A(j,j+1:n);

  end
\end{lstlisting}
In practice, we would typically use a strategy of
{\em deferred updating}: that is, rather than applying the
pivot immediately across all columns, we would only apply
the pivoting within a block of columns.  At the end of the
block, we would apply all the pivots simultaneously.  As with
other blocking strategies we have discussed, this has no impact
on the total amount of work done in some abstract machine model,
but it is much more friendly to the memory architecture of real
machines.

By design, this algorithm produces an $L$ factor in which all the
elements are bounded by one.  But what about the $U$ factor?  There
exist pathological matrices for which the elements of $U$ grow
exponentially with $n$.  But these examples are extremely uncommon in
practice, and so, in general, Gaussian elimination with partial
pivoting does indeed have a small backward error.  Of course, the
pivot growth is something that we can monitor, so in the unlikely event
that it {\em does} look like things are blowing up, we can tell there
is a problem and try something different.
But when problems do occur, it is more frequently the result of
ill-conditioning in the problem than of pivot growth during the
factorization.

\section{Beyond partial pivoting}

Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting has been the mainstay of
linear system solving for many years.  But the partial pivoting
strategy is far from the end of the story!  GECP, or Gaussian elimination
with {\em complete} pivoting (involving both rows and columns),
is often held up as the next step beyond partial pivoting,
but this is really a strawman --- though complete pivoting fixes
the aesthetically unsatisfactory lack of backward stability in the
partial pivoted variant, the cost of the GECP pivot search is
more expensive than is usually worthwhile in practice.  We instead
briefly describe two other pivoting strategies that are generally
useful: {\em rook pivoting} and {\em tournament pivoting}.  Next week,
we will also briefly mention {\em threshold pivoting}, which is relevant
to sparse Gaussian elimination.

\subsection{Rook pivoting}

In Gaussian elimination with rook pivoting, we choose a pivot at each
step by choosing the largest magnitude element in the first row
{\em or column} of the current Schur complement.  This eliminates
the possibility of exponential pivot growth that occurs in the
partial pivoting strategy, but does not involve the cost of searching
the entire Schur complement for a pivot (as occurs in the GECP case).

For the problem of solving linear systems, it is unclear whether rook
pivoting really holds a practical edge over partial pivoting.  The
complexity is not really worse than partial pivoting, but there is more
overhead (both in runtime and in implementation cost) to handle deferred
pivoting for performance.  Where rook pivoting has a great deal of
potential is in Gaussian elimination on (nearly) {\em singular} matrices.
If $A \in \bbR^{m \times n}$ has a large gap between $\sigma_{k}$
and $\sigma_{k+1}$ for $k < \min(m,n)$, then GERP on $A$ tends to yield
the factorization
\[
  PAQ = LU, U = \begin{bmatrix} U_{11} & U_12 \\ 0 & U_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $U_{11} \in \bbR^{k \times k}$ and $\|U_{22}\|$ is very small
(on the order of $\sigma_{k+1}$).

Rook pivoting and the closely-related threshold rook pivoting are
particularly useful in constrained optimization problems in which
constraints can become redundant.  Apart from its speed, the rook
pivoting strategy has the advantage over other rank-revealing
factorizations that when $A$ is sparse, as one can often control the
fill (nonzeros in $L$ and $U$ that are not present in $A$).
The LUSOL package of Michael Saunders is a particularly effective example.

\subsection{Tournament pivoting}

In parallel dense linear algebra libraries,
a major disadvantage of partial pivoting is that the pivot search is
a communication bottleneck, even with deferred pivoting.  This is
increasingly an issue, as communication between processors is far
more expensive than arithmetic, and (depending on the matrix layout)
GEPP requires communication each time a pivot is selected.
For this reason, a number of recent {\em communication-avoiding}
LU variants use an alternate pivoting strategy called
{\em tournament pivoting}.

The idea behind {\em tournament pivoting} is to choose $b$ pivot rows in
one go, rather than iterating between choosing a pivot row and
performing elimination.  The algorithm involves each processor proposing
several candidate pivot rows for a heirarchical tournament.  There are
different methods for managing this tournament, with different levels of
complexity.  One intriguing variant, for example, is the remarkable
(though awkwardly named) {\tt CALU\_PRRP} algorithm, which uses
rank-revealing QR factorizations to choose the pivots in the tournament.
The {\tt CALU\_PRRP} algorithm does a modest amount of work beyond what
is done by partial pivoting, but has better behavior both in terms of
communication complexity and in terms of numerical stability.
